<h1><%= @user.username %> Home Page</h1>

<!-- ADD THE SUPERUSER NAVBAR HERE -->
<!-- NAVBAR: CheckIn Index, Tour Index, User Show (start tour) -->

<!--
basic user SHOW page shows a group of tours to be performed for a given night
each tour element consists of a displayed time with a button, in fact, the time might just go on the button
make the buttons nice and big and easy to understand

once the button is pressed, we redirect the user to the NEW tour page, which requires a selfie image to be uploaded
once the tour has been submitted, we redirect the user to the NEW check-in page

if the user is an administrator, the site directs him/her to the house INDEX page


that home page instead shows several house elements, with their associated tours
the tours might rotate in and out as time goes by, to avoid clutter (previous hour, current hour, next hour, 12 total?) 
move the above 2 lines the the house index view
-->

<!-- need to make tour time send AJAX REQUESTS to update automatically (less important, cause will probably display right time after tour completion anyway), could also separate times depending on whose logged in? (prevents flexibility for workers, though)  -->


<!-- just make a JS function for the tour time? -->
<a href="<%= new_tour_url %>">
	<button>Next Tour: <%= next_tour_time.strftime("%l:%M") %></button>
</a>
