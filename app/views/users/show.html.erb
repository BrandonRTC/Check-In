<h1><%= @user.username %> Home Page</h1>

<!--
basic user SHOW page shows a group of tours to be performed for a given night
each tour element consists of a displayed time with a button, in fact, the time might just go on the button
make the buttons nice and big and easy to understand

once the button is pressed, we redirect the user to the NEW tour page, which requires a selfie image to be uploaded
once the tour has been submitted, we redirect the user to the NEW check-in page

if the user is an administrator, the site directs him/her to the house INDEX page


that home page instead shows several house elements, with their associated tours
the tours might rotate in and out as time goes by, to avoid clutter (previous hour, current hour, next hour, 12 total?) 
move the above 2 lines the the house index view
-->


<a href="<%= new_tour_url %>">
	<button><% next_tour_time.strftime("%l:%M") %></button>
</a>



<!-- 

make the list divs with only one clickable?

**just make one button and display the next tour time, no need to display the rest of them**
