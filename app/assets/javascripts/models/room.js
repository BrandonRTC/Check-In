		// this could be the wrapper for the checkins
		// read back into the wrapper model way of persisting multiple items at once

		// might feel a little odd, as the url will route to the check ins router, but shouldn't matter
		// since the server rooms are basically static, just need to sanitize the room data from the model

		// alternatively, just write a checkInWrapper model; it might be less potentially confusing
